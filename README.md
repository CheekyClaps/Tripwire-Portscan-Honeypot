# Tripwire-Portscan-Honeypot
A Mac OSX suitable portscan honeypot built around Scapy.

## Todo
- Implement ntify
- Make sure the webhooks work
- Make a threshold counter system
- Make a retaliation class
- Make it as light weight a possible and make it in to a runnable background service
- Cleanup the code and refactor classes

## Disclaimer
I just took whatever i could find and slapped it in and made it work. Dont expect to find a finished product or a beautiful symphony of code.
What you will find is an elaboration of ideas i could not find with ease. (meaby because it's so simple that nobody even bothered to make it public)
